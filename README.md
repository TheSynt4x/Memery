<h1>Meme website</h1>

<h2>Information</h2>
<p>This is an updated version of an old project. In short it's a social network/image sharing board where you can upload your own funny pictures, comment on others posts.</p>
<p>This is built using PHP with the framework Slim. As for the front-end I used Bootstrap and simple javascript and a little bit of jQuery to perform certain actions on the website.</p>

<b>The front-end code might be very messy at places but it's fully functional.</b>

<h2>Features:</h2>

</ul>

<h2>Features to be done in the future:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Edit posts</li>
    <li>Delete posts</li>
    <li>Better admin/mod panel</li>
    <li>Tag other users</li>
    <li>Better inbox/notification system</li>
</ul>

<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>To set this up, you would need a webserver preferrably one with PHP 7, since it might not work on older PHP versions due to deprecated functions.</p>
<p>Don't forget to set up the database and then change the mysql credentials in <b>bootstrap/Bootstrap.php</b> to make it work.</p>
